===========================================================
Elasticsearch
- distributed search and analytics engine
- built on top of Apache Lucene
- it's a part of Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)
- it includes Logstash, Kibana
- used for data ingestion, storage, search and visualization
- it stores data in JSON format


Key features of Elasticsearch
- Distributed 
  - it scales horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster
  - automatically replication and sharding data across nodes for high availability and fault tolerance
  - Full-text search
  - Powerful Query DSL - Domain Specific Language
  - Kibana integration - Visualize data stored in Elasticsearch using Kibana


Working of Elasticsearch
- Indexing and Querying (DSL - Domain Specific Language)
- Sharding and Replication
- Distributed search and aggregation


Use Cases
- Log and Event Data Analysis - Can be used for analyzing and monitoring server logs, error logs
- Product search
- APM - Application Performance Monitoring - Store and query metrics to monitor application performance


Elasticsearch Architecture
- Cluster
- Node
- Index
- Document
- Sharding and Replicas

Data logs -> Beats -> Logstash -> Elasticsearch -> Kibana


Installation steps
