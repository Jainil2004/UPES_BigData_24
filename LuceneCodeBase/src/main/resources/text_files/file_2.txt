
Algorithm of Genetic Algorithm
1. Initialization - Generate an initial population of candidate solution (also known as chromosomes)
2. Fitness Evaluation - Each chromosome is evaluated using a fitness function that measure how close it is to optimal solution
3. Selection - Select individuals from the population to breed based on their fitness
4. Crossover - Combine two parent solutions to create on or more offspring
5. Mutation - Occasionally alter offspring to maintain diversity in population
6. Replacement - Replace old population with new population
