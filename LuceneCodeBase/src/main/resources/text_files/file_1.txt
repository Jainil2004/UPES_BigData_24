Genetic Algorithm (GA)

- search and optimization technique
- inspired by process of natural selection and evolution in biology

- Mimics the principles of genetics which includes
  - inheritance
  - mutation
  - selection
  - crossover

GA is used:
  - Global optimization - they are effective at finding global optima
  - Parallelism - explore multiple solutions simultaneously
  - Adaptability - they can work with wide variety of optimization problems
